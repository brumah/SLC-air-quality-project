# SLC Air Quality Project

## Project Overview

Salt Lake City, nestled in a valley with a unique dome-like shape, experiences specific meteorological phenomena that impact its air quality. This geographical formation often leads to the trapping of air pollutants in the lower atmosphere, posing health and environmental challenges. Understanding and predicting these air quality fluctuations are vital for effective public health and environmental policy-making as well as alerting the public of substantially poor air quality days.

## Project Objective

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to understand and predict air quality in Salt Lake City. It addresses two pivotal questions:

1. Can accurate predictions be made for the air quality of the following day?
2. What is the future directional trend of overall air quality?
